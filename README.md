Project Title: Bubble Shooter Game

Technical Description:

The Bubble Shooter game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the DOM to create an interactive gaming experience. The game captures user input through mouse or touch events to launch a bubble towards a target. The position of the bubble is dynamically tracked, and upon hitting the correct target, the score is updated accordingly. A countdown timer is integrated to limit the gameplay duration, and once the timer runs out, the game ends. Bubbles are generated randomly within a defined area, and the entire game can be reset after completion. CSS animations are employed to ensure smooth transitions and enhance the visual effects of the bubbles, providing a fluid and engaging user experience.
Key Features:

Interactive gameplay with real-time input detection
